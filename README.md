# Bike-Sales-Data-Analysis-Excel-Project-

### Project overview

This project showcases data analysis and visualization in Excel using a bike sales dataset. The analysis follows a structured process from cleaning and transformation to pivot tables and creation of an interactive dashboard.


### File: `Excel Project.xlsx`

The file contains:

1. **Bike buyers**: Raw dataset with demographic and behavioral data on potential customers. 

2. **Working sheet**: Cleaned and transformed data with new calculated columns like **Age Bracket**.

3. **Pivot table**: Aggregated data using pivot tables.

4. **Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard summarizing key insights from the dataset.


### Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed in Excel with the following key steps:

- Standardized entries
- Created a new column: **Age Bracket** with categories like young, middle aged and old
- Ensured all columns were ready for analysis (handled blanks and removed inconsistencies)


### Analysis with Pivot Tables

Built multiple pivot tables to summarize:

- **Average income** by gender and purchase decision
- Partitioning of customers based on income and demographics
- Prepared for visual use in the dashboard


### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard (in the last sheet) summarizes:

- Average income by gender and purchase status
- Distribution of purchases by age group and commute distance
- Clean and interactive layout using slicers and pivot charts

### Key Insights

- **Middle-aged** individuals are the most likely to purchase bikes.
- **Higher income** is positively associated with the likelihood of purchase.
- **Professionals** and **married people** make up a significant share of bike buyers.
- **Commute distance** and **region** may influence bike buying behavior.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Slicers
- Conditional Formatting
- Manual Data Cleaning


### About the Project

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel
- Structuring and transforming raw datasets
- Designing effective dashboards for business insights

Ideal for HR, marketing or retail teams aiming to understand customer behavior.


### Future Work

If extended, this analysis could be improved by:

- Adding Excel formulas for trend analysis
- Connecting with Power BI for advanced visuals
- Performing predictive analysis using regression in Excel or Python
